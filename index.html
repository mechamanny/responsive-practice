				bunch of text:  A few moments after, the funnel of the Henrietta vomited forth torrents of smoke. The vessel continued to proceed with all steam on; but on the 18th, the engineer, as he had predicted, announced that the coal would give out in the course of the day.
				"Do not let the fires go down," replied Mr. Fogg. "Keep them up to the last. Let the valves be filled."
				Towards noon Phileas Fogg, having ascertained their position, called Passepartout, and ordered him to go for Captain Speedy. It was as if the honest fellow had been commanded to unchain a tiger. He went to the poop, saying to himself, "He will be like a madman!"
				In a few moments, with cries and oaths, a bomb appeared on the poop-deck. The bomb was Captain Speedy. It was clear that he was on the point of bursting. "Where are we?" were the first words his anger permitted him to utter. Had the poor man be an apoplectic, he could never have recovered from his paroxysm of wrath.
				"Where are we?" he repeated, with purple face.
				"Seven hundred and seven miles from Liverpool," replied Mr. Fogg, with imperturbable calmness.
				"Pirate!" cried Captain Speedy.
				"I have sent for you, sirâ€”"

				<p>As he was reflecting in this wise, his eyes fell upon an immense placard which a sort of clown was carrying through the streets.  This placard, which was in English, read as follows:</p>

				<p>ACROBATIC JAPANESE TROUPE,     HONOURABLE WILLIAM BATULCAR, PROPRIETOR,             LAST REPRESENTATIONS,  PRIOR TO THEIR DEPARTURE TO THE UNITED STATES,                   OF THE          LONG NOSES!   LONG NOSES!  UNDER THE DIRECT PATRONAGE OF THE GOD TINGOU!            GREAT ATTRACTION!</p>

				<p>"The United States!" said Passepartout; "that's just what I want!"</p>

				<p>He followed the clown, and soon found himself once more in the Japanese quarter.  A quarter of an hour later he stopped before a large cabin, adorned with several clusters of streamers, the exterior walls of which were designed to represent, in violent colours and without perspective, a company of jugglers.</p>

				<p>This was the Honourable William Batulcar's establishment.  That gentleman was a sort of Barnum, the director of a troupe of mountebanks, jugglers, clowns, acrobats, equilibrists, and gymnasts, who, according to the placard, was giving his last performances before leaving the Empire of the Sun for the States of the Union.</p>

				But what it was that inscrutable Ahab said to that tiger-yellow crew of his&mdash;these were words best omitted here; for you live under the blessed light of the evangelical land. Only the infidel sharks in the audacious seas may give ear to such words, when, with tornado brow, and eyes of red murder, and foam-glued lips, Ahab leaped after his prey. Meanwhile, all the boats tore on. The repeated specific allusions of Flask to "that whale," as he called the fictitious monster which he declared to be incessantly tantalizing his boat's bow with its tail&mdash;these allusions of his were at times so vivid and life-like, that they would cause some one or two of his men to snatch a fearful look over the shoulder. But this was against all rule; for the oarsmen must put out their eyes, and ram a skewer through their necks; usage pronouncing that they must have no organs but ears, and no limbs but arms, in these critical moments. It was a sight full of quick wonder and awe! The vast swells of the omnipotent sea; the surging, hollow roar they made, as they rolled along the eight gunwales, like gigantic bowls in a boundless bowling-green; the brief suspended agony of the boat, as it would tip for an instant on the knife-like edge of the sharper waves, that almost seemed threatening to cut it in two; the sudden profound dip into the watery glens and hollows; the keen spurrings and goadings to gain the top of the opposite hill; the headlong, sled-like slide down its other side;&mdash;all these, with the cries of the headsmen and harpooneers, and the shuddering gasps of the oarsmen, with the wondrous sight of the ivory Pequod bearing down upon her boats with outstretched sails, like a wild hen after her screaming brood;&mdash;all this was thrilling. Not the raw recruit, marching from the bosom of his wife into the fever heat of his first battle; not the dead man's ghost encountering the first unknown phantom in the other world;&mdash;neither of these can feel stranger and stronger emotions than that man does, who for the first time finds himself pulling into the charmed, churned circle of the hunted sperm whale.
